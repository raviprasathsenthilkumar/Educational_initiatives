SOLID Principles Applied:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

Classes Involved:
- Command (Interface)
- TextEditor (Receiver)
- CopyCommand, PasteCommand, WriteCommand, DeleteCommand (Concrete Commands)
- CommandInvoker (Invoker)

#### Observer Pattern - Weather Station

Use Case:
- Weather monitoring system with multiple display types
- Updates all displays when temperature changes

Key Features:
- One-to-many dependency between objects
- Automatic notification of all observers
- Dynamic attach and detach of observers
- Multiple observer implementations

SOLID Principles Applied:

### 2. Creational Patterns

#### Singleton Pattern - Logger

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open/Closed Principle

Classes Involved:
- LogLevel (Enum)
- Logger (Singleton)
- UserService (Consumer)
- PaymentService (Consumer)
- EmailService (Consumer)

#### Factory Method Pattern - Shape Factory

Use Case:
- Runtime shape creation based on input
- Creates Circle, Square, Triangle, Rectangle, Pentagon

Key Features:
- Defers instantiation to factory method
- Easy to extend with new shapes
- Input validation and error handling
- Flexible dimension handling

SOLID Principles Applied:
- Open/Closed Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle
- Single Responsibility Principle

Classes Involved:
- Shape (Product Interface)
- ShapeFactory (Factory Interface)
- ConcreteShapeFactory (Concrete Factory)
- Circle, Square, Triangle, Rectangle, Pentagon (Concrete Products)
- ShapeManager (Client)

### 3. Structural Patterns

#### Adapter Pattern - Media Player

Use Case:
- Audio player supporting MP3 natively
- MP4 and VLC support through adapter
- Seamless format conversion

Key Features:
- Makes incompatible interfaces work together
- Native MP3 support
- Adapter for external format support
- Transparent interface for client

SOLID Principles Applied:
- Open/Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

Classes Involved:
- MediaPlayer (Target Interface)
- AdvancedMediaPlayer (Adaptee Interface)
- AudioPlayer (Concrete Target)
- MediaAdapter (Adapter)
- Mp4Player, VlcPlayer (Concrete Adaptees)
- MediaLibrary, PlaylistManager (Clients)

#### Composite Pattern - File System

Use Case:
- Hierarchical file system with files and folders
- Uniform treatment of individual and composite objects

Key Features:
- Tree structure representation
- Uniform treatment of files and folders
- Recursive operations (size calculation, display, search)
- File system management utilities

SOLID Principles Applied:
- Open/Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Single Responsibility Principle

Classes Involved:
- FileSystemComponent (Component Interface)
- File (Leaf)
- Folder (Composite)
- FileSystemManager (Client)
- FileSystemBuilder (Helper)

## How to Compile and Run

### Compilation

From project root directory:

```bash
cd src
javac com/designpatterns/behavioral/command/*.java
javac com/designpatterns/behavioral/observer/*.java
javac com/designpatterns/creational/singleton/*.java
javac com/designpatterns/creational/factory/*.java
javac com/designpatterns/structural/adapter/*.java
javac com/designpatterns/structural/composite/*.java
javac com/designpatterns/DesignPatternsApplication.java
```

### Execution

Run complete demonstration:

```bash
java com.designpatterns.DesignPatternsApplication
```

## SOLID Principles Applied

### Single Responsibility Principle
- Each class has one reason to change
- TextEditor only handles text operations
- Logger only handles logging
- Shape classes only represent shapes

### Open/Closed Principle
- Open for extension, closed for modification
- New observers can be added without modifying WeatherStation
- New shapes can be added without modifying ShapeFactory
- New commands can be added without modifying CommandInvoker

### Liskov Substitution Principle
- Subtypes are substitutable for base types
- All Shape implementations can substitute Shape interface
- All Observer implementations can substitute Observer interface
- MediaAdapter can substitute MediaPlayer

### Interface Segregation Principle
- Clients not forced to depend on unused interfaces
- Observer and DisplayElement are separate interfaces
- MediaPlayer and AdvancedMediaPlayer serve different purposes
- Shape interface is focused and minimal

### Dependency Inversion Principle
- High-level modules depend on abstractions
- ShapeManager depends on ShapeFactory interface
- Services depend on Logger behavior, not implementation
- CommandInvoker depends on Command interface

## Key Design Decisions

1. Modularity
   - Each pattern in separate package
   - Clear organization and separation of concerns

2. Interfaces First
   - All patterns use interfaces for polymorphism
   - Enables flexibility and testability

3. Error Handling
   - Comprehensive validation
   - Meaningful error messages
   - Graceful failure handling

4. Documentation
   - Inline comments explain design choices
   - Javadoc-style documentation
   - Clear naming conventions

5. Testability
   - Dependency injection throughout
   - Interfaces enable easy mocking
   - Loosely coupled components

6. Extensibility
   - Easy to add new implementations
   - Minimal changes required for extensions
   - Follows Open/Closed Principle

## Learning Outcomes

After studying this project:

- Understand when and how to apply each design pattern
- Learn how SOLID principles guide better design
- Differentiate between behavioral, creational, and structural patterns
- See real-world applications of design patterns
- Understand how patterns work together in larger systems
- Learn best practices for object-oriented design

## Pattern Relationships

Command and Singleton:
- Commands can use singleton Logger for tracking

Observer and Factory:
- Observers can be created via factory methods

Adapter and Composite:
- Media library could use composite for playlist management

Factory and Adapter:
- Factory could create adapted objects dynamically

## Extension Ideas

1. Repository Pattern
   - Add persistence layer for data management

2. Strategy Pattern
   - Implement different undo strategies
   - Multiple algorithm implementations

3. Decorator Pattern
   - Add shape styling and enhancement
   - Runtime behavior modification

4. Proxy Pattern
   - Implement lazy loading for large files
   - Access control and caching

5. Chain of Responsibility
   - Media format detection pipeline
   - Request handling chain

6. Builder Pattern
   - Complex object construction
   - Fluent API design

7. Template Method Pattern
   - Define algorithm skeleton
   - Allow subclass customization

## Technical Requirements

Java Version:
- Java 8 or higher required
- Uses modern Java features (lambda expressions, streams where applicable)

Dependencies:
- No external dependencies
- Standard Java libraries only
- Pure Java implementation

Build System:
- Manual compilation with javac
- Can be integrated with Maven or Gradle
